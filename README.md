# State-Based-LWW-Element-Graph

- Description:\n
  Implementation of a state-based LWW-Element-Graph with test cases.
  The graph contain functionalities to:
  - add a vertex/edge
  - remove a vertex/edge
  - check if a vertex is in the graph
  - query for all vertices connected to a vertex
  - find any path between two vertices
  - merge with concurrent changes from other graph/replica
