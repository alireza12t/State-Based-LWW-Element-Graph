# State-Based-LWW-Element-Graph

- ## Requirements
  - Xcode Version 12.5 (12E262)
  - Swift Version 5.4
  
- ## Installation Instructions

  Install Xcode Version 12.5 (12E262) and open State-Based LWW-Element Graph.playground file with Xcode

- ## Description

  Implementation of a state-based LWW-Element-Graph with test cases, The graph contain functionalities to:
  - add a vertex/edge
  - remove a vertex/edge
  - check if a vertex is in the graph
  - query for all vertices connected to a vertex
  - find any path between two vertices
  - merge with concurrent changes from other graph/replica

  Iâ€™ve included my README in the Playground.
